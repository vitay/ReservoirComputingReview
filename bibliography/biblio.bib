@conference{Lowe2011,
  abstract = {This paper presents a biologically constrained reward prediction model capable of learning cue-outcome associations involving temporally distant stimuli without using the commonly used temporal difference model. The model incorporates a novel use of an adapted echo state network to substitute the biologically implausible delay chains usually used, in relation to dopamine phenomena, for tackling temporally structured stimuli. Moreover, the model is based on a novel algorithm which successfully coordinates two sub systems: one providing Pavlovian conditioning, one providing timely inhibition of dopamine responses to salient anticipated stimuli. The model is validated against the typical profile of phasic dopamine in first and second order Pavlovian conditioning. The model is relevant not only to explaining the mechanisms underlying the biological regulation of dopamine signals, but also for applications in autonomous robotics involving reinforcement-based learning.},

  abstract = {The brain's ability to tell time and produce complex spatiotemporal motor patterns is critical for anticipating the next ring of a telephone or playing a musical instrument. One class of models proposes that these abilities emerge from dynamically changing patterns of neural activity generated in recurrent neural networks. However, the relevant dynamic regimes of recurrent networks are highly sensitive to noise; that is, chaotic. We developed a firing rate model that tells time on the order of seconds and generates complex spatiotemporal patterns in the presence of high levels of noise. This is achieved through the tuning of the recurrent connections. The network operates in a dynamic regime that exhibits coexisting chaotic and locally stable trajectories. These stable patterns function as 'dynamic attractors' and provide a feature that is characteristic of biological systems: the ability to 'return' to the pattern being generated in the face of perturbations.},

@article{Sussilo2009,
  abstract = {Neural circuits display complex activity patterns both spontaneously and when responding to a stimulus or generating a motor output. How are these two forms of activity related? We develop a procedure called FORCE learning for modifying synaptic strengths either external to or within a model neural network to change chaotic spontaneous activity into a wide variety of desired activity patterns. FORCE learning works even though the networks we train are spontaneously chaotic and we leave feedback loops intact and unclamped during learning. Using this approach, we construct networks that produce a wide variety of complex output patterns, input-output transformations that require memory, multiple outputs that can be switched by control inputs, and motor patterns matching human motion capture data. Our results reproduce data on premovement activity in motor and premotor cortex, and suggest that synaptic plasticity may be a more rapid and powerful modulator of network activity than generally appreciated.},
