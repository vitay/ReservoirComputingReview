<div>The brain is a highly complex, recurrently structured dynamical system. To understand its dynamic behavior, computational models are essential, since mere experimental observation cannot deliver mechanistic insights and comes with spatiotemporal limitations regarding the brain states that can be observed. In recent years, reservoir computing has become a popular modeling framework for the inbrain.&nbsp;</div>
