<div>The brain is a highly complex, recurrently structured dynamical system. Computational models are essential to understand its dynamic behavior, since mere experimental observation comes with spatiotemporal limitations regarding the brain states that can be observed and cannot deliver mechanistic insights and . In recent years, reservoir computing has become a popular modeling framework for the investigation of various brain systems and phenomena.&nbsp;</div>
