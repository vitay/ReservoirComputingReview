<div>The brain is a highly complex, recurrently structured dynamical system. Computational models are essential to understand its dynamic behavior, since mere experimental observation comes with spatiotemporal limitations regarding the brain states that can be observed and cannot deliver mechanistic insights by itself. In recent years, reservoir computing has become a popular modeling framework for the investigation of various brain systems and phenomena. Initially introduced by H. JÃ¤ger and W. Maas, reservoir computing comprises the family of randomly connected recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and has been shown to have universal computation capacities. While it has originally been proposed as a machine learning concept, it has proven useful for understanding</div>
